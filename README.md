# Ticktack

A decentralized social platform enables people to share knowledge and exchange value, with an end to end encrypted messaging feature. 

You can find [installers for Linux, Mac, and Windows on the Releases page](https://github.com/ticktackim/ticktack-workplan/releases).

#### Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ticktackim/ticktack-network/wiki/Code-of-Conduct) and [Reminder](https://github.com/ticktackim/ticktack-network/wiki/REMINDER) before your installation. 

#### Write a blog and use the channel `new-people` to introduce yourself after installation, then you will meet friends of other scuttleverse within the network. 


## Development

### Repos

- ` ssb://%wnNDjViKYZH+RWpbNzDXR2oxLWmTagvvFBjy97Zko4I=.sha256`

### Install

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run rebuild
```

### App env

To run a **embedded sbot** setup (recommended - this is how the installer will run):

1. run `npm start`
2. to debug sbot from terminal, run `$ sbot whoami` or `$ sbot progress`

**Note** you'll need a `~/.ssb/config` file to be able to do (2).
It should have the plugins you're using and a copy of the content of `default-config.json`, so will look something like (this example may be out of date, as we're no longer running a private network):

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "ssb-about": true,
    "ssb-backlinks": true
  },
  "port": 43750,
  "blobsPort": 43751,
  "ws": { "port": 43751 },
  "caps": {"shs": "ErgQF85hFQpUXp69IXtLW+nXDgFIOKKDOWFX/st2aWk="},
  "autoinvite": "128.199.132.182:43750:@7xMrWP8708+LDvaJrRMRQJEixWYp4Oipa9ohqY7+NyQ=.ed25519~YC4ZnjHH8qzsyHe2sihW8WDlhxSUH33IthOi4EsldwQ="
}
```

There are a couple of ENV vars made available to make development easier:
```
$ STARTUP_DELAY=0 STARTUP_PAGE=addressBook npm start
```
`STARTUP_DELAY` - defaults to `2000`ms, setting it to 0 skips the splash screen pause
`STARTUP_PAGE` - defaults to `blogIndex`, setting this to another page makes refreshing the app to a particular named page easy.


To run **standalone sbot** setup with standard ssb key + network :

1. start you sbot `$ sbot server`
2. run `$ npm run start-electro` in the repo directory

Remember that you will need the right sbot plugins installed on your global sbot.


### Translations

Theses are in `/translations`.
There's a helper script in there called `checker.js` which looks for translations in `en` (english) that are missing from `zh` (mandarin).


### TODO

There are some issues with some lower level scuttlebutt deps (scuttlebot, muxrpc?). For the moment we've pinned these deps:
- "scuttlebot": "10.4.10",
- "secret-stack": "4.0.1", (added in order to stop version of muxrpc drifting up. can remove later)
- "ssb-client": "4.5.2", (added in order to stop version of muxrpc drifting up. can remove later)
